This is the Chrome extension part of the Classified Cloud. This is what the user will press when on a page that they would like to save. It is also what embeds the email-saving button into Gmail. The user needs to sign in the first time, but after that, the computer should be recognized and no more logging in is required, although it is still possible to log out.

Adding to Chrome:

Go to Window > Extensions
Click "Load Unpacked"
Navigate to this chrome extension folder on your computer, and press Select
Now the "CC" icon should appear in the top right of your browser

Setup:

First, make an account on the actual website.
Open the extension and click "Login"
Input the email address and password associated with your account, and hit "Submit"

Basic Usage:

To save a page, open the extension and click "Save Page"
Log out at any time with the "Logout" button

Sharing with Other People

If you would like to share it with other people on Classified Cloud, type their email under "Share With:"
You can add as many emails as you want by hitting the plus button
Now, when you press submit, all of those people will get the page, too
